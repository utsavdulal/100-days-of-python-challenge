# Day 10 â€“ Python Exercises

This folder contains Python scripts for Day 10 of the 100 Days of Python Challenge.

Day 10 focuses on **functions with outputs, conditional logic, and building small projects** using functions, loops, and dictionaries.  
You will practice returning values from functions, working with user input, and creating simple projects like a calculator.

- **`format_name.py`** â€“ Function that formats first and last names:

  - Uses `.title()` to format names correctly.
  - Returns the formatted name instead of printing directly.
