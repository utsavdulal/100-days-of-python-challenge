# Day 7 â€“ Python Exercises

This folder contains Python scripts for Day 7 of the 100 Days of Python Challenge.

Day 7 focuses on **creating a text-based Hangman game** using Python modules, lists, loops, and user input.  
You will practice importing custom modules, working with lists, and using loops and conditionals to create an interactive game.

## ðŸ“‚ Files in this folder:

- **`hangman.py`** â€“ Main game script. Runs the Hangman game, selects a random word from the word list, and tracks user guesses and lives. Displays ASCII art for hangman stages as the game progresses.

- **`hangman_words.py`** â€“ Contains a list of words (`word_list`) from which the game randomly selects the target word.

- **`hangman_arts.py`** â€“ Contains ASCII art for the hangman stages (`stages`) and the game logo (`logo`) displayed at the start of the game.
