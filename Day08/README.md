# Day 8 â€“ Python Exercises

This folder contains Python scripts for Day 8 of the 100 Days of Python Challenge.

Day 8 focuses on **functions, loops, conditionals, and imports** to create practical mini-programs.  
You will practice writing reusable functions, passing arguments, using mathematical calculations, and implementing simple algorithms like the Caesar Cipher and Prime Checker.
