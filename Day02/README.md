# Day 2 â€“ Python Exercises
This folder contains Python scripts for Day 2 of the 100 Days of Python Challenge.

Day 2 focuses on basic Python fundamentals, including user input, variables, data types, math operations, string formatting, and operator precedence. The exercises help build a foundation for programming in Python through small projects and practical examples
