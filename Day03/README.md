# Day 3 â€“ Python Exercises

This folder contains Python scripts for Day 3 of the 100 Days of Python Challenge.

Day 3 focuses on **control flow** and **logical operators** in Python.  
You will learn to use `if`, `elif`, `else`, nested conditions, and logical operators (`and`, `or`, `not`) to build interactive programs.
