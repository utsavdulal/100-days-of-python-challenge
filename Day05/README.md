# Day 5 â€“ Python Exercises

This folder contains Python scripts for Day 5 of the 100 Days of Python Challenge.

Day 5 focuses on **loops, range, and basic list operations**.  
You will practice `for` loops, iterating through lists, using `range()`, and combining loops with conditionals.

## ðŸ“‚ Files in this folder :

- **`average_height.py`** â€“ Finds the average height of students. Takes input as a list of heights, calculates the total using a `for` loop, counts the number of students, and computes the average.

- **`highest_score.py`** â€“ Finds the highest score from a list of student scores entered by the user using a `for` loop and conditional comparison.

- **`sum_even_numbers.py`** â€“ Calculates the sum of all even numbers from 1 to 100 using a `for` loop with a step of 2.

- **`fizz_buzz.py`** â€“ Prints numbers from 1 to 100, replacing multiples of 3 with `"fuzz"`, multiples of 5 with `"buzz"`, and multiples of both with `"FuzzBuzz !"`.

- **`fruits_shake.py`** â€“ Iterates through a list of fruits and prints each fruit followed by `" shake"`. Also demonstrates a simple `for` loop to print `"utsav"` once.

- **`password_generator.py`** â€“ Generates a random password based on user input for the number of letters, numbers, and symbols using the `random` and `string` modules.

- **`sum_1_to_100.py`** â€“ Calculates the sum of numbers from 0 to 100 using a `for` loop.
