# Day 9 â€“ Python Exercises

This folder contains Python scripts for Day 9 of the 100 Days of Python Challenge.

Day 9 focuses on **dictionaries, nesting, and building small projects** that use keyâ€“value pairs, lists, and loops.  
You will practice nesting dictionaries within lists, dictionaries inside dictionaries, and using data structures to model real-world scenarios.
