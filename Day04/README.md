# Day 4 â€“ Python Exercises

This folder contains Python scripts for Day 4 of the 100 Days of Python Challenge.

Day 4 focuses on **Python modules, randomization, and list operations**.  
You will learn to use the `random` module, lists, nested lists, 2D grids, and interactive programming in Python.
